# react-weather-directory-app

This app uses react with redux to implement different types of components. 
I use the redux concepts to store states of different containers within the application. 
The application is used as follows: 
- step 1: search for a city
- step 2: view the details about temperature, humidity, and pressure

I implemented this app to get more familiar with the redux state concept and middlewares. 
I did some api work by making a get call to a weather api and getting data back. 
I use this data through out the application to render different views using react.
